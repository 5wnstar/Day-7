This code helps to get the protcol name of any port number within TCP or UDP protocol 

If you would like to discover network services, it may be helpful to determine what network 
services run on which ports using either the TCP or UDP protocol.


If you know the port number of a network service, you can find the service name using the 
getservbyport() socket class function from the socket library. You can optionally give the 
protocol name when calling this function.
